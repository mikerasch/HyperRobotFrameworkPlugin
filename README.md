# Hyper Robot Framework
This is a fork of the unmaintained HyperRobotFrameworkPlugin which will introduce features I want.
Note: If you want an UPDATED robotCode, see https://github.com/robotcodedev/robotcode. It has a decent bit to go, so in the meantime, I am going to stick with this outdated tech.

# Installation
1) Download latest jar in /latest package.
2) Open IntellJ or Pycharm
3) Navigate to File -> Settings -> Plugins -> Click Gear -> Install Plugin from Disk
4) Select Plugin
5) Do NOT update the plugin if you want to retain this fork.

# Changelog
06-15-2025 <- Added enviroment variable support for *** Settings ***. This will fetch all System.getProperties AND .env files. Any duplicate key will be overwritten by .env. 


# Issues?
I am not going to maintain this project. For pretty much anything you want, https://github.com/robotcodedev/robotcode will be your guide.
